Speaker 0    00:04:39    Maybe you struggle, you can get some kind of sex facts. Yeah. I'm learning  
Speaker 1    00:04:43    Something. Yeah. Yes, yes, of course. Like you,  
Speaker 0    00:04:47    When you struggle through my experience, I can also tell that at first I had a huge headache, how will I'm going to deal with this. But when you start to learn bit by bit, then there is also another point of view in which we learn a lot of things, new things. Yes. And we feel kind of satisfaction.  
Speaker 1    00:05:09    Yeah. Yeah, of course.  
Speaker 0    00:05:10    How hard work is paying a lot.  
Speaker 1    00:05:14    Uh, because, uh, I have a lot of tasks, then I am, uh, sitting on it many hours and I, each and every time I understanding the concept. So it, it pays very well. Yes. Yes. For the next time I'll understand the problem, I'll understand the issue. So I'll get some satisfaction, like, I learned this thing.  
Speaker 0    00:05:35    Yes. And plus you'll get a lot of  
Speaker 1    00:05:37    Experience. Experience new, new  
Speaker 0    00:05:38    Things.  
Speaker 1    00:05:38    Yeah. Yeah. I  
Speaker 0    00:05:39    Understand. Very good. So can you walk me through a typical day at work for you? Like your routine of the day in professional life?  
Speaker 1    00:05:49    Uh, in a professional life, uh, in a daily routine, I work up at 11:00 AM or 12:00 PM mm-hmm <affirmative>. And after my, uh, food and I will sit on the laptop because So  
Speaker 0    00:06:05    You work remote?  
Speaker 1    00:06:06    Yeah. I don't need to go to the, uh, office because it's almost everything is coding. Every, everything is coding. So I don't need to go for the So you don't need to travel also travel hours. Yeah. I can just sit on my laptop and I can work remotely mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I will sit on the laptop and working on it, and after a few time I will get bored. Then I will switch into my HSE, uh, account steps or otherwise I will watch some videos. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I leave. And again, I will come to the job. That's my daily opinion.  
Speaker 0    00:06:46    So are there any specific tasks look for what to do that, I mean, that which you have to do daily or it keeps on changing or you receive some kind of instruction day on a daily basis that you have to do this, do this, you work like this, or you have just the formal tasks, which you are, which is common for each and every day and you just <inaudible>.  
Speaker 1    00:07:08    Yeah. I don't need any specific task for every day. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like, they already assigned me a task. Almost 60 tasks. Yeah. Yes. Almost 60 tasks I need to finish within this month. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So if you finish early, then you are free.  
Speaker 0    00:07:28    Oh. So it's like, uh, gold tax, you need to complete it in whatever time.  
Speaker 1    00:07:34    Yeah. You are free. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:07:37    Okay. I got your point.  
Speaker 1    00:07:38    It's like a free, uh, it's about the flexible.  
Speaker 0    00:07:42    It's very flexible. Good, good. That you have to work remotely and you are flexible. So how do you describe what your company does? Well, we know that your company works for it, but you could also narrow down what specifically in it they do.  
Speaker 1    00:08:01    They actually do, uh, finding the, uh, contract works. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. To, it's like a HHR. If you take HR, it's like a, uh, for, for the students or for the employees, they want to find some jobs in HR. So the employers will, uh, put the jobs job mark, job vacancies. So we will find the jobs. So it's also kind of similar method, but it's in the construction, uh, field, like, uh, road construction or like, uh, yeah, it's kinda big, big market, big construction, but works. So it's about contracts. So the employees, not the employees, the people who need the work, they will put the, uh, work on the website. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It's like 1 billion Robles or 1 million Robles like contract. And anyone can say that, uh, this and they can apply for it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. It's kind of website. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:09:10    It's kind of, uh, IT marketplace. Yeah. You can find the work. Yeah. Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:09:16    Not for the, it it's for the construction.  
Speaker 0    00:09:19    It's for everything.  
Speaker 1    00:09:19    Everything. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:09:20    Okay. I guess. Okay. We good? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:09:25    So I am developing on that website.  
Speaker 0    00:09:27    Okay. So you are working for this website? Yeah. You are like IT department.  
Speaker 1    00:09:33    Yeah. And  
Speaker 0    00:09:34    Yeah, I got your point. So what excites you about being part of this company?  
Speaker 1    00:09:43    Uh, well first of all,  
Speaker 0    00:09:45    Because maybe sometimes we work for some company, but we don't like to work. But sometimes we do what we like and we feel good and satisfied about it. But I know a lot of students who don't like their work, but still they have nothing to do. So they do. That's, but I guess you are very much satisfied and I feel your work, so I want to just know.  
Speaker 1    00:10:11    Yeah. Actually, I'm  
Speaker 0    00:10:11    Excited you about being part of this company.  
Speaker 1    00:10:14    Yeah. I'm actually satisfied with this company, this task actually, because, uh, uh, my favorite job like IT program. And anyway, it's a new program, new language for me, JavaScript ranch, I didn't study before, but I'm studying on it and I'm learning. And this will pace me very well in a, in future, maybe in northern this company, maybe in different countries, maybe in Dubai, maybe in India. Like I will get some good experience with good salary. So I'm satisfied with this job, but I'm struggling to figure out, figure out. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:10:58    Since you are already new in this company, so I don't understand.  
Speaker 1    00:11:01    Yeah, it's my first company. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Even in Russia, even in my professional life. It's your first work? It's my first workplace.  
Speaker 0    00:11:09    Oh, great. Uh, so how do you know that you have succeeded in your way at the end of the day? How do you evaluate yourself? That I had done something or I was able to meet the expectation of this company? How do you, uh, judge this part of your work? Like identify this part of your work?  
Speaker 1    00:11:43    Uh, well, um, each and every task I will go through it and I will try to solve and I will report to my senior of developer and they said, okay, and I will go to the next task. And I'm finishing like that.  
Speaker 0    00:12:03    Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay. I got to your point. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So can you say a moment when you felt particularly very successful? Like very satisfied that you are very happy with something that you have done for all the talks?  
Speaker 1    00:12:18    Yeah, it's, uh, my technical test for getting this job. I had a technical test, like make a website similar to this company, like if a publication mm-hmm <affirmative>. So first of all, it was my first experience that to make a website and I use YouTube and I study JavaScript from the Indian channels mm-hmm <affirmative>. And I tried to make and make it like a similar to the company web, web application, and I could achieve, and I am happy to know that I could make a website mm-hmm <affirmative>. In a very short period.  
Speaker 0    00:12:59    Oh, that's great that you belong through YouTube and all these stuff, and you can really make a website. Wonderful. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So what do you think in this period, this is your professional period? Yeah. So what do you think you, uh, need to do well in this period? That, how can you make yourself, uh, really worthful in the eyes of your company? What all steps you can take to prove yourself that you're really work for them? If they don't hire you, they'll lose something.  
Speaker 1    00:13:37    Um, like  
Speaker 0    00:13:38    What parameters do you work on for this?  
Speaker 1    00:13:41    What, what  
Speaker 0    00:13:42    Parameters do you work on for these fulfilling this criteria? Maybe because they'll judge you.  
Speaker 1    00:13:48    Yeah. Maybe they'll  
Speaker 0    00:13:50    Judge you or, because everywhere they have probation, they see how you work or they want to see that what is your method, what is your way of thinking, everything. And then they decide that you can hire this guy or not. Everywhere. It's same. So what parameters do you follow? Do you think it's ary?  
Speaker 1    00:14:13    Uh, like the main parameter is the task. If I finish the task very well before that, uh, that one month, then it would be better for them, for me. Like I, I will secure my job in, in this company. They'll evaluate about my task, how I'm doing, how much if fast I'm doing like that.  
Speaker 0    00:14:38    So basically you do it early, that means, uh, you are really willing Yeah. And carry on all the task. Yeah. And you are already everything because uh, it could, the same task could take like 10 x time. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So yeah, you are right. So has your company supported you in reaching those goals? What are support they gave you and how they are mentoring you or they're guiding you?  
Speaker 1    00:15:08    Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:15:09    What support do you feel is very crucial in your work? Or if they're not, so what are your expectations?  
Speaker 1    00:15:20    Like, first of all, it's my remote job and  
Speaker 0    00:15:23    But still you have the problem. Must be having a mentor or guy or someone.  
Speaker 1    00:15:28    I don't, I don't, I don't have any proper mandate for this. Okay. So I'm, that's why I'm get little struggling for it to figure it out. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. How the task is, how the structure of this project look like. Where should we work, where should we need to improve? So, uh, for that I am figuring out myself. That's why I'm getting little struggle and it'll take time. But if, uh, sometimes I'll ask to my senior developer and they will say, uh, they'll say something, but  
Speaker 0    00:16:04    It's not really worth,  
Speaker 1    00:16:06    It's not worth food. And even they don't speak English. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:16:09    <affirmative>. Okay, I got your point. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:16:12    No one will speak English. So I'm speaking with them in Russian, but even sometimes I don't understand what they say. Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:16:21    Understand. Yeah. But still all this struggle will make you a really good  
Speaker 1    00:16:30    Yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:16:30    <laugh> candidate everywhere. Anywhere you go, all this world. So you know how to deal with all this kind of situation already. So anywhere you go, I hope we will not find any kind of trouble. Because you have gone through everything. So is all this hardship is making you a better  
Speaker 1    00:16:47    Yes. Thank you <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:16:49    Candidate in the freedom of it, uh, what signals do you, to you that the job is being well done? Well, like, can you give an example or any case where you feel like, oh, I'm gonna be great, is there any case or like any appreciation by a company or something like this?  
Speaker 1    00:17:14    Yeah, I got in the starting there because I just finished my technical test and they, they told me that they didn't even expect I will do this much things this much. Oh wow. Like they have some, they have some expectation, I will do this, this, this. But I did better than their expectation. So performance? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:17:41    Oh, great.  
Speaker 1    00:17:43    Like I made like a company website.  
Speaker 0    00:17:45    Yeah. It's a tough job. I can understand. So they were very satisfied. Yeah. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And you also were very happy.  
Speaker 1    00:17:54    Happy,  
Speaker 0    00:17:55    Yeah. So now we'll stick to culture Objection and challeng challenges. How has it been for you, a new working environment in Russia in general? Events say that you have come from very social culture and here the culture is very <inaudible>. So how difficult, uh, was or easy or it was for you, easy, whatever is your opinion this year? Us,  
Speaker 1    00:18:23    Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:18:25    New working environment or new networking, new country culture or something like this, you must have failed because if for everyone, when we come from a different culture or different country or different background or different place, so we had some kind of hesitation in the very first mm-hmm <affirmative>. And we slowly get used to that environment and then feels like, okay, it's fine. We can really adapt to, so  
Speaker 1    00:18:51    Here in Russia, I don't feel any difficulties in working. Also, uh, I don't feel any pressure from the company. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:19:00    So money here, I guess that it can comparison to India, the work pretty is pretty relaxed.  
Speaker 1    00:19:06    Relaxed,  
Speaker 0    00:19:07    Yeah. Yeah. I can also say all of my experience, I know a lot of guys, the work culture, the workplace is pretty, pretty balanced, is not like you must, you are so much better and you need to work very hard. You like the working hard to get your done and every way everybody's,  
Speaker 1    00:19:31    But even myself, I'm getting pressured myself because you,  
Speaker 0    00:19:36    You want to  
Speaker 1    00:19:37    Get secure my position how  
Speaker 0    00:19:40    When you are, it's your first job. So I can understand your feet pressure to do that,  
Speaker 1    00:19:48    To satisfy them.  
Speaker 0    00:19:49    Yeah, I understand. And what about you, like personal life, do you feel any kind of, uh, uh, say like cultural soc  
Speaker 1    00:20:02    Uh, no, <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:20:04    An example where, can you say an example in which you feel like this is completely like 360 degree away from India? Or like from wherever you belong to you, like, uh, your local environment. Do you feel any kind of like cultural shock in your personal life? Not in working, or you can say just about your personal life, if you not working, do you feel something, uh, in good and bad anyway, in whatever experience you have? You can say,  
Speaker 1    00:20:37    Uh, for me, cultural difference, like, uh, I can say that. Uh, yeah, it's, uh, what you say, I came from a village area. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So in a village area, it's typically everyone should be know each other. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, like in a circle, maybe two kilometer radius of circle. The people know each other, maybe five kilometer away from the circle. Like people know each other and they have some cooperation. But, uh, and even St. Petersburg, it's a city not even in the village. So even in our city also, there are some issues like that. So, um, I have a difference because I was living in a village and I living right now, I'm living in a city. So there's a, uh, difference in the life. Like it's a city culture. I live in a village. So even if I take in my home country, if I go to the city, I feel the same, uh, difference. I feel the same, uh, environment. I can get it from the same as well. So it's not a, that much big difference between like,  
Speaker 0    00:22:05    So have you been to any ocean village ticket?  
Speaker 1    00:22:09    No.  
Speaker 0    00:22:10    So you don't know?  
Speaker 1    00:22:12    No. Like I'm saying that  
Speaker 0    00:22:14    I Yeah. But your point, if I sit from a small place to big place,  
Speaker 1    00:22:18    I, yeah. Even if even it's happen in India also, like  
Speaker 0    00:22:23    Yeah, I got your point. From there, if you have to like chi <inaudible> or I got your point, but as a country, like as a country, you see any kind of changes. Maybe you haven't lived in many big cities, but you know about your country, how people behave, how people talk, what are the cultural things more particularly focused there. But what are things, uh, what are the things here? People, how they behave, how they react, how they, you are being in college. Yeah. Yeah. University. So you must be knowing their uh, way of thinking, way of communication, way of celebration. We have good Russian friends as well, you know.  
Speaker 1    00:23:03    Yeah. So  
Speaker 0    00:23:05    From all over the,  
Speaker 1    00:23:06    From the beginning, <laugh>, I have a lot of good friends. Yes. In my classroom, even outside the classroom, in the outside the HSE, everywhere, I got some, a lot of good. Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:23:18    So do you find any kind of like pattern or like any kind of particular changes for in Russia in comparison to India? So you have friends from India. India in this  
Speaker 1    00:23:31    City? Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:23:32    As far as I know. From your place?  
Speaker 1    00:23:35    Yeah, I have friend also, but,  
Speaker 0    00:23:37    Uh, so how do you feel the difference when you talk with Indian friends and when you talk with Russian friends, there must be some kind of changes because we all are from different, different country, different culture, the thinking, everything's different. So can you say something about this?  
Speaker 1    00:23:55    Uh, but for me, I don't know, like boys, always boys,  
Speaker 0    00:23:58    Boys are only boys. Boys, you know, sometimes people are very friendly. Like people say that India is friendly country, like people love to talk. Even if you don't know each other, we can talk for two hours. Yeah. But Russia is a bit different.  
Speaker 1    00:24:10    Yeah. Don't saying  
Speaker 0    00:24:11    That it's impossible, but it's a bit difficult to have like two, uh, come on the same call, same flow, then we, everything is like, okay. So, but it takes time to break the, yeah. Uh, hesitation.  
Speaker 1    00:24:27    Uh, like, uh, I'm talking about my Russian friends. I mean, my best friends, not everyone, my best friends I consider as my Indian friends, same level. Because they also think like our same mentality, same <inaudible>. So I mean, there's not that much difference, like I can tell anything.  
Speaker 0    00:24:48    Mm-hmm.  
Speaker 1    00:24:49    Even they'll tell me a anything even they don't think about what is the any bad, because we understand.  
Speaker 0    00:25:00    I understand. Good mutual. Yeah. Understanding in between you, so you can discuss time. Yeah. Okay, good. Got your point. So do you find challenges, why taking into the company culture, like as you said, you don't have a mentor mm-hmm <affirmative>. So do you find it, do you find this as a difficulty or do you see it as a challenge?  
Speaker 1    00:25:30    Yeah, it's actually challenge because I never see these people before. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I only know my company, CEO and the technical CEO and other peoples, I never saw them be before because they're different parts of the Mm.  
Speaker 0    00:25:49    So they all are working in  
Speaker 1    00:25:50    <inaudible>? Yeah. They're not in St. Petersburg. Only two people are in ST school. The director and the technical director. These two people. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Russia people are in different countries. They're Russians, but they're in remote. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:26:07    Working from,  
Speaker 1    00:26:10    Yeah. <inaudible>  
Speaker 0    00:26:13    Online work could be done too many. Yeah. Oh, great. Okay. So, okay, we covered how you work on these challenges. So you don't have any supervisor. Okay.

Speaker 1    00:33:59    Yeah, because it's, it's like, it's like, uh, very difficult to get a foreigner  
Speaker 0    00:34:05    Yeah. In Russia. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:34:07    To get a job here. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:34:10    Because most of them, they are either working like  
Speaker 1    00:34:14    Call center, call centers,  
Speaker 0    00:34:15    Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:34:16    Customer support.  
Speaker 0    00:34:17    And you have a typical uh, uh, like typical job, just like a local.  
Speaker 1    00:34:25    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:34:27    So is very good. It's very highly appreciated that you were,  
Speaker 1    00:34:33    Because I was searching for the job, like not in H-H-R-U-I.  
Speaker 0    00:34:39    Uh, so you had a different approach Yeah. To pop up with this  
Speaker 1    00:34:43    Situation. Yeah. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:34:44    <affirmative>. Which pays off.  
Speaker 1    00:34:45    Yeah. Because I directly go to the office or company and I will ask them, do you have any job or something like that? Mm-hmm <affirmative>. I will met every HR managers in every company without any invitation. I just directly match. And because my aim is to get a job mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I will choose, uh, different companies in the map and I will decide today I will cover these companies. And finally, um, I got two interviews and I got this company right now and one company yesterday called me for the interview. It's like a mechanism of drone, like automation. They're working on the drone company. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, for the automation of the working. The moment it's like a more to like to my field, like machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So I will also apply for that interview there. Call for me the interview. So soon I will also attend that interview also because these jobs are, I approach them.  
Speaker 0    00:36:01    So what did you think that instead of applying are, which is the most popular site for getting job? You should approach each one of the company Personally, what was your approach? Because mostly company put all their CIE on it.  
Speaker 1    00:36:16    Time. Yeah. First of all, that's, it's Dou, it's like a lingering mm-hmm <affirmative>. And this both, uh, website will work in a algorithm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Like they have a set of algorithm. If it's satisfied, only our resume will send to their company. We think that, uh, we got a lot of rejection letters from the HRU, like we thought that, oh, this company, people will read this resume, resume this managers will read the resume and they are sending the message. But not, it's not like that because this HHRU will filter out and they will put the ion letter mm-hmm <affirmative>. Because it's like a set of algorithm. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So we need to make the CV like that. So not everyone will get the idea or not everyone will get the opportunity to get the otherwise who will read the 10,000 CVS <laugh> with the one HR manager or two HR manager. It is not possible. So they have set of, uh, algorithm to filter out.  
Speaker 0    00:37:30    So you decided to go personally  
Speaker 1    00:37:33    Yeah. New  
Speaker 0    00:37:34    Way. Which, which really worked off. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:37:38    Because on that, in this sense, uh, I can meet, meet the HR manager and the HR manager also can meet me. So at least I can make the interview procedure  
Speaker 0    00:37:52    Great. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Wow. So, so thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. We having the discussion. Thank you so much for taking our time for this interview.
